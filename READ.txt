Class 29 This was by far the longest class I've ever gone through.
Lack of openings and closings of tags made it all happen.
GetUserFeed was implemented but it was in profile.php that I caught the most, as it was here
that the appearance of the news feed was implemented and for lack of a tag it
did not work. I think it was really bullshit, because of the size of mistakes I made

Class 30 Foi feito uma nova função para trazer fotos dentro do PostDaoMyslq o getPhotosFrom que traz as fotos
Deu um erro que só se resolve colocand once_require em tudo que é lugar. Essa aula 30 Foi
bem mais tranquila que a 29
