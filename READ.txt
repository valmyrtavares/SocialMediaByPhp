Very important. I took a lot of errors due to lack of attention, but the project is getting

There's a new trick about calculating years that's in lines 36 to 38 that kill the riddle with
very easily. There was still a variable with the name of the day that was destroying the count
of years, but thanks to debug I found the error properly
