In Auth we do a little verification if the email exists using what is already in the dao,
that's when you understand the weight of Object Orientation. No Signup_action is where the work is from.
fact done, in this commit we have the verification of dates and if the email exists, if the user exists
cannot be registered again with the same email. The part of actually sending the data
will be done in the next commit
